🌐 My Web Development Journey
-----------------------------

Hi, I’m Shivansh Dubey 👋
This repository is a collection of my learning journey in web development. I started with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and built some projects along the way to strengthen my understanding.

📚 What I’ve Learned
---------------------

✅ HTML5 – Structure of web pages, semantic tags, forms, links, media, etc.
✅ CSS3 – Styling, layouts, flexbox, grid, animations, responsive design.
✅ JavaScript (ES6+) – DOM manipulation, functions, events, arrays, objects, loops, conditionals, and more.

💻 Projects I’ve Built
-----------------------

Here are some projects I created while practicing:

Portfolio Website – My personal portfolio built with HTML & CSS.
QR Code Generator – A simple JavaScript app that generates qr of given text.
Netflix Clone – Duplicate of Nelflix (non-wrking)
